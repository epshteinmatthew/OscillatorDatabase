# Oscillator Database
## A Web-Based Database for Chemical Network Models

A database hosted on the internet can be a cost-effective and user-friendly method of publishing and accessing chemical network models. In this project, we use GitHub repositories to store the aforementioned models. We also implement several interfaces through which users can access the models, as well as a workflow for contributors to add to the database itself. We conclude that, at a reasonable scale, this implementation achieves the goals of cost-effectiveness and user-friendliness, and is thus fit for further use. We find that the database is able to perform in a satisfactory manner and without significant slowdowns at scale.
